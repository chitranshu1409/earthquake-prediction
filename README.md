python src/main.py
```

## Data Source

The earthquake data is fetched from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) API. The data includes information about earthquake magnitudes, locations, depths, and times.

## Algorithms and Methods

This project uses several machine learning algorithms for earthquake prediction, including:

- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

The models are trained using features engineered from the raw earthquake data, such as statistical measures, zero-crossings, peak counts, FFT values, and the Hilbert transform's amplitude envelope.

## Example Project

This project serves as an example of using machine learning techniques for predicting natural events. It demonstrates data fetching, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
